NeuroClick - Analyzing Brainwave Signals To Understand What Clicks
==========

NeuroClick is a platform consisting of various tools to interface with the Neurosky device and performed semi-automated experiments with users and archive data anonymously. In this project, human subject experiments are run on various volunteered subjects whose brain wave signals are collected when they are presented various stimuli like text, pictures, videos. We analyzed the data using standard correlation techniques to see whether there is any correlation between features of brainwave signals and stimuli presented to the human subjects.
